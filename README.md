## libraries used
 1- keras 
 2- numpy
 3- cv2
 4- glop
 5- sklearn
 6- imutils // https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils
 7- imgaug  // https://github.com/aleju/imgaug            for image augmentation

## DataSet
  I uploaded the generated dataset to github repo. then i will do image augmantaion on it at run time to minimize dataset size
  the dataset URL : https://github.com/Rawash/Google-Colaboratory-datasets

## Notebook code:
  i used Google Colaboratory to train the model using GPU so in notebook code i add some codes to help me upload the dataset to Google Colaboratory also to dawnload the model form it  

aslo you can find in the repo. the initial model (v2) and the final model (v6) in the model folder
